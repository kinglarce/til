# Data Engineering

Five V's

* volume (the quantity of data points)
* variety (type and nature of the data: text, image, video, audio)
* velocity (how fast the data is generated and processed)
* veracity (how trustworthy the sources are)
* value (how actionable the data is).

Data Engineer lays the ground to Data Scientist to work on.

| Data Engineer          | Data Scientist           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Ingest and store data  | Exploit data             |
| Setup databases        | Access databases         |
| Build data pipelines   | Use pipeline outputs     |
| Strong software skills | Strong analytical skills |

Data Engineering

* Ingest,  Process, Store, Need pipelines, Automate flow from one station to next, Provide up-to-date, accurate, relevant data

Data Pipelines

| Automate       | Reduce                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Extracting     | Human intervention         |
| Transformation | Errors                     |
| Combining      | Time it takes data to flow |
| Validating     |                            |
| Loading        |                            |
