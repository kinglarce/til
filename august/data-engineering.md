# Data Engineering

Five V's

* volume (the quantity of data points)
* variety (type and nature of the data: text, image, video, audio)
* velocity (how fast the data is generated and processed)
* veracity (how trustworthy the sources are)
* value (how actionable the data is).

Data Engineer lays the ground to Data Scientist to work on.
